              In 1967, Jones opened his first store selling clothes and accessories in New York City.</span></p>

In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television
                    sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how to play properly. By the time The
                    Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.</span></p>

                Created for the television situation comedy of the same name. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers remembered the "wool hat" guy, and called Nesmith back.</span></p>

He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings.</span></p>
