# The Monkees band website

This is the first project for the Code Institute. The aim was to produce a multi page website on the Monkees (the band).
The website targets fans both old and new and provides them with the latest news and gigs as well as the ability to watch and listen to music.
This website, although based on a real band, is of course fictional, and suggests all members of the band have reformed and are touring across
the country. They are also available to book for special occasions! 

## UX

As a user of this website I want to be able to navigate easily around the site. The navigation bar is clean and vibrant with headers 
clearly labelled informing the user the purpose of the page. It is also responsive and alters in a user friendly way depending on screen size.

As a user I need to enjoy looking at the website, ie. the design needs to be attractive and motivate users to explore the site. With this in
mind I used a 60's colour palette (google search) to create authenticity of the 60's era. The fixed background was black and white which
gives an old fashioned feel to the site working well with the vibrant colours.

As a user I would want to be able to find social media icons easiy ont the site (in the real world these would provide real links to various media platforms).

For the home page, I would want to see clearly when the next gigs are, the ability to book tickets and the latest news and music. This
has been displayed in sections to clearly distinguish each area. I would also like to see images of the band to make the website more visually appealing.

As a monkees fan, old or new, or curious...I would want easy access to listen to the Monkees music. This, along with a video is displayed on the Music page.
I would also want to be able to read about each band member.

Finally, as a user I would want to be able to book the band. The website allows users to do this by the use of a booking form.

## Features

Responsive Navigation bar, colourful with links to each page of the website. 

'Home page' - contains the latest gig dates and location, a (non existant) link to book tickets, and information on the latest news of the band.
The home page contains a gallery section displaying images of the band.

'Music page' - allows user to listen to the Monkees in the form of audio/video. The page contains audio links to play 4 different Monkees songs, and the ability to watch a Monkees video.

'The Guys' page - this page allows users to read a little bit about each member of the band. There is an image of each band member to accompany the text. The text also
provides a 'read more' link to a wikipedia page for each band member. This has been implemented to prevent the page becoming too text heavy, 
but still providing the user with access to read and learn more about the band.

'Book Us' Page - allows users to register interest in booking the monkees for a gig for a special occasion. The user is able to fill out a form 
using their name and email and the date they would like to request. There is also a textarea box to provide more detail of request. 

Footer - Provides social media icons, with the use of css animation when hovered over. The links are deliberately not set as this is not a real world website.
The footer also provides an email input box to enable users to be able to sign up to the latest news.


## Another feature idea

I would implement a more detailed latest news section. 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

HMTL - forms the basis of the site. Semantic code has been used in line with the latest version of HTML (5)
CSS - used extensively throughout the website to provide style and layout.
Bootstrap - used for forms and crucial grid system providing a responsive website.
FontAwesome - used for the icons.
Google Fonts - provides fonts for the site.

## Testing

This website has been tested on multiple screen sizes using chrome dev tools. It has also been tested on real devices such as iphones, samsung phones etc. 
All HTML and CSS was passed through W3C validator with no errors. 

Navbar testing - all links successfully navigate to the desired page.
The use of media queries has been used to ensure suitable layout continues on all screen size.
All audio links and the video has been tested and works without any issues.
All links (excluding ones deliberately left out due to this being a fictional website) including to youtube and wikipedia work without any isssues. 


## Deployment

This website has been deployed to github pages and can be viewed <a href="https://caputocode.github.io/the-monkees-website/">here.</a>

## Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from the research of many band websites, particularly with fixed backgrounds.
I was inspired to use a 60's colour theme and found this through google search and google's colour picker.
